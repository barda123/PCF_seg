this directory needs to contain a few things:
Firstly, a symbolic link to the shared "pericardial" directory on the GPU machine (contact Aaron), where manual segmentations are stored (create this!)
A spreadsheet containing details of the ~3700 person UK Biobank cohort that is articularly of interest (healthy and diabetic people with imaging data recorded). Not sure what has happened to this, chase with Zahra Raisi-Estabragh/get her to search emails
You should create a symbolic link to "imaging_by_participant", the folder which contains all of the zipped raw UKBB data
