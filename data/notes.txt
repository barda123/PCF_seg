this directory needs to contain a few things:
Firstly, a symbolic link to the shared "pericardial" directory, where manual segmentations are stored
A spreadsheet containing details of the ~1600person UK Biobank cohort that is particularly of interest (healthy and diabetic people)
A symbolic link to "imaging_by_participant", the folder which contains all of the zipped raw UKBB data
