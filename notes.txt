A sensible list of admin-type things that will need to happen:

Load a contour file from wsx in some format ... parse_cvi42_xml.parseFile() ??

Load a dicom image and convert to numpy(?) ...

Test for matching between contour and dicom (via UID? other metadata?)

test for matching between contour and FRAME of dicom (i.e ensure that image and mask ACTUALLY match)

More efficient way of matching/looking up than repeat-tests? May just be asking Zahra to store more clearly, or something

Create some kind of image, from a contour - allowing pixel-wise correspondence with an image

Write an image (i.e. a segmentation output) to a contour file so it can be evaluated in cvi42 (THIS IS GOING TO BE HARD)

raw image data (zipped) is in:
/biobank/imaging_by_participant




POTENTIAL ISSUES affecting network efficacy:
data heterogeneity
missing data... sort once a finalised dataset has been discussed.
